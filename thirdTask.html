      <p>
        Hello dear reader, today I will provide you with information about one
        of the exotic places in Ukraine - a pink lake located in the north of
        the Arabat Spit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="leftImg + widthImg" src="./photo/4.jpg" alt="lake" />
        The size of the reservoir is almost 5 km long and 3 wide. The lake is
        fed by the waters of the Sivash, which enter the lake through a narrow
        strait, as well as from underground artesian wells and bottom sources.
        The salinity of Lake Geniche reaches 150 g/l in the hot season, with a
        predominance of common salt in the brine.

        Salt lakes on the Arabat Spit, which are part of the Genik group lakes,
        for centuries have been a source of table salt for peoples, inhabiting
        these lands. From the first half of the 19th century, the region began
        the rapid development of industrial salt mining, and Lake Genicheskoe
        becomes the most important among the reservoirs of the spit, where
        sedimentary salt is mined. IN In 1840, the largest salt industry
        appeared here, in three branches of which produced up to 50,000 tons of
        salt per year. Owner enterprises, General Meshkov was able to create a
        production that is still is considered a model for the production of
        sedimentary salt. At the best of times the fishery produced 11 types of
        salt, including pink mullet, which repeatedly received the highest
        awards of the Brussels exhibition. In the XX century, a salt-mining
        plant was opened on the basis of the salt mine, which was the
        city-forming enterprise for Priozernoye, located on shore of Rose Lake.
        The plant worked until the early 2000s, with gradual decrease in annual
        volumes to 20,000â€“25,000 tons, from most of which were technical salt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the production is not working, and all the pink salt, which is sold
        in the markets of Arabatka, is mined in an artisanal way. It does not go
        through the stage of industrial cleaning, but, according to local
        residents, it is quite suitable for salting fish. In the area of the
        village of Priozernoe, you can see the remains of wooden checks,
        overgrown with salt crystals, against which tourists like to be
        photographed.
